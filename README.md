Update: [Now on CTAN!](https://ctan.org/pkg/realtranspose)
Update: [Now avaiable for MiKTeX!](https://miktex.org/packages/realtranspose)

Have you ever thought "*I wish mathematical notation would arrive in the 21st century?*"

Now you can *finally* define a symmetric matrix the right way!

You can even go full apesh\*t-crazy!

![Literally, how could noone have implemented that beefore?](img/int.png)

Now is your time to do it!

## Usage

It's as easy as `1 succ(1) succ(succ(1))`!
```latex
\usepackage{realtranspose}

\begin{document}
A matrix is symmetric iff
\[ A = \realtranspose{A} \]
\end{document}
```
