\maketitle

\texttt{realtranspose} is a package for \LaTeX that allows writing a transposition by 
actually rotating the characters provided. This follows the geometric intuition of a
matrix transposition. In action, it looks like

\[
  A^T =: \realtranspose{A}
\]

It also preserves the math style, for example $\realtranspose{ \sum_{j = 0}^T }$ keeps
the indizes in text style while
\[
\realtranspose{ \sum_{j = 0}^T }
\]
has the real display style indizes.
\subsection*{Installation}
The only package needed is \texttt{graphicx}. Just install it with
\begin{lstlisting}
latex realtranspose.ins
\end{lstlisting}
